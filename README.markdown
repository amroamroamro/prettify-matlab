MATLAB syntax highlighting for google code prettify
===================================================

This script provides MATLAB syntax highlighting for the
[google-code-prettify][1] project. Intended to be used on [Stack Overflow][2]
and other Stack Exchange sites.

Currently the code recognizes the following constructs:

 - single line as well as block comments (`% this is a comment`)
 - quoted string (`'hello world'`)
 - number literals (`1`, `-2.5`, `1i`, `2.9E-5`, etc...)
 - system commands (`!touch filename`)
 - line continuation characters (`...`)
 - transpose operator (single quote) vs. strings
 - command prompt/command output (`>> now`)
 - error/warning messages (`??? Error in ...` and `Warning: ...`)
 - parentheses, brackets, braces (`()`, `[]`, `{}`)
 - other operators (`<>=~@&;,:!-+*^.|\/`)
 - MATLAB language keywords (`if`, `else`, `end`, etc...)
 - some special variables and constants (`inf`, `nan`, `varargin`, etc..)
 - over 1300 builtin functions from core MATLAB (`cos`, `plot`, etc...)
 - additional functions from popular toolboxes ([Statistics][6], [IPT][7], and [Optimization][8])
 - user-defined indentifiers (function and variable names not matched in previous steps)

See the wiki for sample screenshots.


BUILDING
--------

If the files don't already exist, run `rake SO:build` to create the output
javascript files in the `js` directory using the templates sources from `src`.
(This step requires Rake, a Make-like build tool for Ruby, used here to provide
basic template processing).


Stack Overflow
--------------

To obtain MATLAB syntax highlighting on Stack Overflow, install the
`js/prettify-matlab.user.js` userscript with your preferred browser (see [this
page][3] for some instructions).

The script is only activated on questions tagged [`matlab`][4].

In addition, a separate userscript is included to allow switching the language
used by the prettifier. It adds a small button to the top-right corner of each
code block, with an attached drop-down menu to allow language selection.
To add this functionality, install the `js/switch-lang.user.js` userscript.


MATLAB Answers
--------------

Similarly, you can apply the syntax hightighting on [MATLAB Answers][5] website
from MathWorks. Simply install the `js/prettify-mathworks-answers.user.js`
userscript.


google-code-prettify extension
------------------------------

To apply the MALTAB syntax highlighting on code snippets in your own web pages,
first include the prettify scripts and stylesheets in your document (as explained
in the [prettify][1] project documentation). To use the MATLAB language extension,
include the `js/lang-matlab.js` script, and place your source code inside a
preformatted HTML tag as follows:

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-matlab">
        <code>
       	% example code
       	x = [1,2,3];
       	sum(x.^2)
        </code>
    </pre>

Upon calling `prettyPrint()`, this will automatically be pretty printed, and the
default styles will be applied. You can customize them with your own, or use the
provided CSS file in `css/lang-matlab.css` which resembles the color scheme of
the MATLAB IDE (with some additions of my own).

Check the `demo/index.html` file for a demonstration.
